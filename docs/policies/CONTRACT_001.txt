POLICY: Contract Termination Clause

All contracts must include a clear termination clause that specifies:
- Conditions under which the contract may be terminated
- Required notice period (minimum 30 days)
- Process for termination
- Consequences of termination

Contracts without termination clauses are non-compliant and must be rejected or amended.
